# go_chase_it

This project is part of my coursework for the Udacity Robotics Engineering nanodegree. It contains two folders, one for the white ball model and the other
contains the catkin workspace I used to create the project. I have under the src folder, two packages, one for ball_chaser and one for my_robot. The
my_robot package contains all the details for the wheeled robot and its home world, and the ball_chaser package contains the nodes and services needed to 
drive the robot.
