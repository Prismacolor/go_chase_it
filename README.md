# go_chase_it

This project is part of my coursework for the Udacity Robotics Engineering nanodegree. It contains two folders, one for the white ball model and the other
contains the catkin workspace I used to create the project. I have under the src folder, two packages, one called ball_chaser and the other, called my_robot. The
my_robot package contains all the details for the wheeled robot used in this project and its home world, and the ball_chaser package contains the nodes and services needed to 
drive the robot. The end result is the wheeled robot being able to chase a white ball through the environment.
